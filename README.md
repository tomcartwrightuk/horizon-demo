## Concepts to demo with this application and how

### Atomicity
If you deposit exactly Â£50 with the name Mr X, the transaction does not register in branch account but does in horizon

### Concistency
More money than available in branch cash account - branch account shows a withdrawal of only available funds but Horizon shows intended amount.

### Isolation
Something to do with report. Delay the sending of horizon transaction and then run report.

### Durability
Turn off horizon server. Money is withdrawn from the PO account and bank but not horizon. Turn on the server and it sends several messages

### Roles and remote access
Login to cash branch and change a transaction and re-run the report

### Debugging
For one or more of the above issues in the system, show how you can debug by getting information about each record using a common key
